## Project description

The aim of this project is to develop a network of IOT devices monitoring the usage of trash cans. Such devices would measure the amount of trash collected by each trash can, reporting it to a central server. Data would be used to organize collection routes, scheduling a bin for collection only when it is full or "almost full", optimizing trash collection. By analyzing the data, we would be able to understand the average use of the trash can, quantitavely set a fullness threshold, hence defining when a can is "almost full". This usage observation could also be repeat periodically, to detect potential seasonal changes to the use of the trash cans, and react accordingly. Moreover, statistical analysis could show most frequently used bins, more active areas, which could serve to consider bins reallocation, to better serve the public space.
