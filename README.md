## Project description

The aim of this project is to develop a network of IOT devices monitoring the usage of trash dumpsters. Such devices would measure the amount of trash collected by each trash dumpster, reporting it to a central server. Data would be used to organize collection routes, scheduling a dumpster for collection only when it is full or "almost full", optimizing trash collection. By analyzing the data, it will be possible to understand the average use of the trash dumpsters, quantitavely define a fullness threshold, hence defining when a can is "almost full". This usage observation could also be repeat periodically, to detect potential seasonal changes to the use of the dumpsters, and react accordingly. Moreover, statistical analysis could show most frequently used dumpsters, more active areas, which could serve to consider dumpster reallocation, to better serve the public space.
